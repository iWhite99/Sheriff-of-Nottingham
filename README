Homework - Sheriff of Nottingham

Implementation of the game 'Sheriff of Nottingham' using OOP Concepts

Rules of the game are adapted for the homework

Game logic in code:
-> Main class used for the initialization of the input data for the game
-> Round represents the class where subRounds start
-> SubRound represents the class where the following start:
   -> Each player takes 10 goods
   -> Each player adds to his bag the goods according to the strategy used
   -> Each player declares the goods he added to his bag - honest or not
   -> The sheriff checks the other players according to the strategy used
-> The number of the SubRounds will always be the number of the players

Important classes used:
-> Package players
   -> Player -> Abstract class
             -> Includes general methods that should be used within
                the Player subclasses - useful for different strategies
      -> BasicPlayer -> Player subclass
                     -> Player with a basic strategy
                        -> Basic strategy
         -> GreedyPlayer -> BasicPlayer subclass
                         -> Player with a greedy strategy
         -> BribedPlayer -> BasicPlayer subclass
                         -> Player with a bribe strategy

-> Package common
   -> Constants -> Various constants used in the code
   -> Bonus -> Various method used to calculate the final score

-> Package rounds
   -> Round -> Class that represents a round
   -> SubRound -> Class that represents a subround

-> Package main
   -> Main -> Used to adapt the input data, run the rounds, add the bonuses,
              sort the players by their score, and print them
